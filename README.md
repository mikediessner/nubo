# NUBO

NUBO, short for Newcastle University Bayesian optimisation, is a Bayesian
optimisation framework for the optimisation of expensive-to-evaluate black box
functions, such as physical experiments and computer simulations, developed by
the [experimental fluid dynamics research group](https://www.experimental-fluid-dynamics.com)
at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk). It focuses on transparent implementations
of algorithms and precise references and documentation for all methods to make Bayesian
optimisation accessible for researchers from all disciplines. NUBO is written in
[Python](https://www.python.org) and distributed open-source under the
[BSD 3-Clause license](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/licence/bsd-3-clause-new-or-revised-license).

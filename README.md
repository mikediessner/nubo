# NUBO

NUBO, short for Newcastle University Bayesian optimisation, is a Bayesian
optimisation framework for the optimisation of expensive-to-evaluate black box
functions, such as physical experiments and computer simulations. It is
developed and maintained by the
[experimental fluid dynamics research group](https://www.experimental-fluid-dynamics.com)
at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk). NUBO focuses primarly on
transparency and user experience to make Bayesian optimisation easily
accessible to researchers from all disciplines. Transparency is ensured by
clean and comprehensible code, precise references, and thourough documentation.
User experience is guaranteed by a modular and flexible design, easy-to-write
syntax, and careful selection of Bayesian optimisation algorithms. NUBO allows
you to tailor Bayesian optimisation to your specific problem by writing the
optimisation loop yourself using the provided building blocks. Only algorithms
and methods that are sufficiently tested and proven to perform well are
included in NUBO. This ensures that the package remains compact and does not
overwhelm with an unnecessary large number of options. The package is written
in [Python](https://www.python.org) but does not require expert knowledge to
optimise your simulations and experiments. NUBO is distributed as an
open-source software under the
[BSD 3-Clause license](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/licence/bsd-3-clause-new-or-revised-license).
